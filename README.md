## Description

I made this program to simplify the task of organizing and maintaining a company's employee database. This program makes it easier to create, update, and store long-term data regarding roles, salaries, employees and their respective managers. in the making of this program i learned a lot about the fascism that is SQL and the cancer it creates in its users.

## Installation

1) open the terminal and navigate to folder containing server.js\2) type 'npm i' and hit enter\3) now enter mysql -u root -p and enter your password\4) once the SQL command line is open enter 'source ./db/schema.sql'\5) after getting the 'OK' enter 'source ./db/seeds.sql'\6) after getting the 'ok' type 'quit' and press enter\7) once on the original command line terminal type 'node server.js'  refer to usage section for details on using this program
